# Centre the data by subtracting the mean to each data point
# Use dot product and project onto each unit vector --> determine which gives the highest variance to find a principal component
# TWo dimentionsal data produces two dimenions, from ehich you choose to reduce 
# Transforming the data by simply rotating does not produce any error
